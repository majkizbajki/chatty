# Chatty.

The project was completed as a recruitment task in React Native technology using Typescript. Its main goal was to create a simple chat app and connect it to the API using GraphQL. The libraries I used were mainly:

-   react-native v0.72.3
-   react-navigation
-   @apollo/client and graphql
-   i18next / react-i18next
-   react-native-paper
-   react-native-reanimated

## Design

The design of the page is based on the custom mockups created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wpfMMHPJlIlpPNvWnMQdir/Chatty-mobile-app---recruitment-task?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=x01YDdiFRCJMzRRH-0).
